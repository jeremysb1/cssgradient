# Gradient Text

A gradient is a progression of colors with a starting and stopping point. 

A linear gradient starts with one color (like a red) and gradually transitions in a straight line to another color (like a blue). Think about sunsets as the best example of a linear gradient and how each color progresses seamlessly into the next.
